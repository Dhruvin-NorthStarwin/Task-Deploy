# ✅ Production Configuration Complete - RestroManage Task Module

## 🚀 Build Status: SUCCESSFUL ✅

The RestroManage frontend has been successfully configured and built for production deployment.

## ✅ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **🔒 Authentication Token Bug** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
- **Issue**: `uploadFile` function was using wrong localStorage key
- **Impact**: File uploads were failing with 401 Unauthorized errors
- **Fix**: ✅ Updated token retrieval to use consistent `'auth_token'` key
- **Verification**: Token management is now consistent across all API calls

### 2. **🔇 Debug Logging Cleanup** (PERFORMANCE & SECURITY - FIXED)
- **Issue**: Extensive console.log statements in production
- **Impact**: Performance degradation and information leakage
- **Fix**: ✅ Made all debug logging conditional based on `config.DEBUG` flag
- **Verification**: Production build has debug logging disabled

### 3. **⚙️ Environment Configuration** (CONFIGURATION - FIXED)
- **Issue**: Debug mode enabled by default, development settings in production
- **Fix**: ✅ Proper production environment variables and build configuration
- **Verification**: Production build uses correct API URLs and settings

### 4. **📦 Build Scripts & Dependencies** (DEPLOYMENT - FIXED)
- **Issue**: Missing TypeScript definitions and build configuration
- **Fix**: ✅ Added React types, updated build scripts, created deployment scripts
- **Verification**: `npm run build` completes successfully

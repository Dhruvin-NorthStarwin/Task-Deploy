# CORS Configuration - Hardcoded Railway URLs

## Issue Fixed
The "submit for review" button was failing due to CORS policy errors between the production Railway URLs:
- **Frontend**: `https://task-module.up.railway.app`
- **Backend**: `https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app`

## Root Cause
The CORS configuration was not properly hardcoded for the specific Railway production URLs, causing intermittent failures when the frontend tried to communicate with the backend.

## Solution: Hardcoded Production URLs

### 1. Frontend Configuration (`frontend/src/config/environment.ts`)
```typescript
// HARDCODED: Production URLs for Railway deployment
const PRODUCTION_FRONTEND_URL = 'https://task-module.up.railway.app';
const PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL = 'https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app/api';
const LOCALHOST_BACKEND_URL = 'http://localhost:8000/api';
```

**Logic:**
- If running on production domain → Use production backend
- If running in development → Use localhost backend
- Clear domain-based detection with hardcoded URLs

### 2. Backend CORS Configuration

#### A. Settings (`backend/app/config.py`)
```python
# CORS - Hardcoded production URLs for Railway deployment
ALLOWED_ORIGINS: Union[str, List[str]] = Field(
    default="https://task-module.up.railway.app,https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173,http://localhost:5174",
    env="ALLOWED_ORIGINS"
)
```

#### B. Main Application (`backend/main.py`)
```python
# Hardcoded production origins for Railway deployment
production_origins = [
    # Production Railway URLs - HARDCODED for reliability
    "https://task-module.up.railway.app",
    "https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app",
    # Local development URLs
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://localhost:5173",
    "http://localhost:5174",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5174"
]
```

#### C. CORS Middleware (`backend/app/middleware/cors_middleware.py`)
```python
# HARDCODED: Essential production origins for Railway deployment
essential_origins = [
    "https://task-module.up.railway.app",              # Production frontend
    "https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app",  # Production backend
    "http://localhost:3000",                           # Local dev (React)
    "http://localhost:5173",                           # Local dev (Vite)
    "http://localhost:5174",                           # Local dev (Vite alt port)
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",                          # Local dev (127.0.0.1)
    "http://127.0.0.1:5173",                          # Local dev (127.0.0.1)
    "http://127.0.0.1:5174"                           # Local dev (127.0.0.1)
]
```

### 3. Environment Files

#### Development (`.env`)
```bash
# HARDCODED: Production Railway URLs for reliability
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app/api
VITE_DEBUG=true
```

#### Production (`.env.production`)
```bash
# HARDCODED: Production Environment Variables for Railway Frontend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://radiant-amazement-production-d68f.up.railway.app/api
VITE_DEBUG=false
NODE_ENV=production
```

## CORS Headers Verified
The production backend now correctly returns:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://task-module.up.railway.app`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Requested-With, Cache-Control, Pragma, Accept, Upgrade-Insecure-Requests`

## Deployment Notes

1. **No environment variable dependency**: URLs are hardcoded in the codebase
2. **Clear separation**: Development uses localhost, production uses Railway URLs
3. **Fallback protection**: Multiple layers of CORS configuration ensure reliability
4. **Domain detection**: Frontend automatically detects if it's running on production domain

## Testing
- ✅ CORS preflight requests work between production URLs
- ✅ Local development continues to work with localhost
- ✅ Submit task functionality should now work in production

The hardcoded approach ensures that the CORS configuration is reliable and doesn't depend on environment variables that might not be set correctly during deployment.
